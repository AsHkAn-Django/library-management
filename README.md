# Library Management

Just a quick little project I made while practicing Django and backend development.
This is part of my journey as I learn and improve my skills.

---

##  About the Project

This is a basic **Library Management System** built using Django. It includes simple frontend styling with **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and some **JavaScript**.

The system allows users to borrow and return books. Books are managed with stock tracking and **unique barcodes**, and all borrow-return activity is recorded.

This project is part of my learning process as I transition into backend development, with a strong focus on writing clean, understandable code.

- Track book stock in real time
